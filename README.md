A couple of scripts for the Sketch app.

### Simple Mail Merge

Duplicate an art board or group and replace the text inside the labels with user-provided data. This plugin expects csv data and will replace numeric tags (tagged with curly braces {}) with the csv data.

Note: this plugin has been moved to its own repository: https://github.com/kumo/sketch-mail-merge
